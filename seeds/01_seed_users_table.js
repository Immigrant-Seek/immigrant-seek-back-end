At a young age, he knew that he wanted to see the world. So at age seventeen he traveled to Israel as a summer foreign exchange student. This first international experience changed the course of Dominic's life. During his junior year in college, Dominic studied abroad in France where he eventually obtained his first immigration case—he met and later married his wife, Marie, who was a French citizen at the time and who immigrated to the United States. Mr. Cullen earned a B.A. in Political Science with a minor in French from the University of Iowa in 1986. As previously mentioned, during the course of his undergraduate studies, he spent one year studying at the Universite de Franche-Comte in Besancon, France. Upon graduation from college, Dominic moved to the New York City area and landed his first job as a paralegal for Barst and Mukamal, which at the time was known to be the oldest and largest immigration law firm. While working at Barst and Mukamal, he studied law in the evening and earned his Juris Doctorate degree from Seton Hall University in 1994. He is admitted to the bars of the states of New York and New Jersey." },

I was determined to do better, and it has been my guiding principle to always offer my clients the best representation that I can provide." },
